      - body: "### About Us\n\nEstablished on this site in 1972, Dardanup Primary School with 136 students draws its clientele from surrounding rural towns and within. Our families choose the tranquillity of a rural lifestyle just 20km from the city of Bunbury benefitting from the resources and facilities of a large city. Buses transport students from Ferguson Valley, Burekup, Boyanup, Dardanup West, Waterloo and Wellington Mills.\n\nOur priorities are:\n\n* Behavioural Development\n* Literacy\n* Numeracy\n* STEM\n\nOur professional staff are committed to providing each student with opportunities for growth academically, socially and emotionally. Our school aims to make the students’ primary school years memorable and enjoyable whilst building a solid educational foundation that fosters lifelong learning habits.\_\_\n\nThe school grounds are landscaped with large grassed playing areas. A basketball court is regularly used for after school team training as well as during school hours. The Nature Playground is a feature of outdoor play at Dardanup Primary School. This playground continually develops in stages to provide our students with challenges and expectations of more to come. Students show nature play working at its best by creating their cubbies with natural resources gathered from the surrounding environment. This is the essence of nature play with children working together to create, problem solve, social play, leadership and having fun at play.\n"

          ### Library


          Dardanup Primary School has a well-equipped library with over 13,000
          books catering to the interests of all students. Thanks to our P & C
          we have new furniture that has created an inviting space with areas
          that allow students to read quietly or play games and be creative.


          A weekly visit to the library is incorporated into the class
          timetable. Students are welcome to exchange books with supervision
          outside of their class time. The library is open at lunchtime on
          Monday and Thursday.


          Students in Kindy and Pre-Primary may borrow one book, Year 1 – 4 may
          borrow 2 books and Year 5 – 6 may borrow 3 books. All students must
          have a library bag for borrowing.
