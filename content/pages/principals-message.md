      Dardanup PS embraces its values of Care, Respect, and Responsibility and
      that is the common theme that we attempt to follow in all our dealings
      with our work, our environment and the relationships within our school.
      Steeped in the long tradition of the Maypole we enjoy a close sense of
      community, excellent facilities, attractive grounds and academic success
      in our small school. As you look around our website you will get a feel
      for our school, the students and staff who work within and the strength of
      the partnerships with our wider school community.
