      Our school is fortunate to have a very strong Parents and Citizens
      Association (P\&C). The school prides itself on a high level of parent and
      community involvement in school activities and the P\&C is a driving force
      in this regard. The P\&C provides an opportunity for parents and citizens
      to learn about the educational program in the school, and support the
      provision of amenities. Funds are raised through various fundraising
      activities throughout the year including the Dardanup Arts Spectacular and
      The Bull and Barrel Show parking. Your personal involvement, as well as
      being informative and enjoyable, is very important to your child and is
      most appreciated by the school. New members are always welcome
